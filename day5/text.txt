// useMemo 
    useMemo helps memorize (cache) the result of a caluculation so that it does not run again unless there are changes in 
    the dependecies

    useMemo(callbackFunction , [dependecies]) // it will return calculared momorized value -> reducing exponsive function call , while components is rendering , it will return computed value  

    // useEffect -> side effects - after the components get render - will not return anything
