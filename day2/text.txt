4 - Props and State Lifting


React: 
    React is an JavaScript Libary
    Use to Build User Interfaces (UI)
    Single Page Applications (SPA)

Why React? 
    Componened-Based Structure : Break UI into smaller part
    Virtual DOM : Improve performance with efficeint rendering 
    Popular &  Supported  by massive community
    Great EcoSystem. (Hooks, Redux, React Router)


Componened: 
    A Componened is a function that returns JSX 
    It is resuable, independent, and encapsulated logic + UI 
    Name should start with capital later

JSX:
    JavaScript XML -> similar to html file but it is combination of both HTML + JavaScript 


Vite: 
    Vite is a tool that helps you build, and server modern JavaScript apps (React)
Why we need vite? 
create react app (CRA) -> why we shifted to vite 


Multiple Cloths -> Componened
Create a Jacket -> sttiches all Cloths into single jacket (bandle -> load into browser) 
Jacket's pokcet you want of different color (CRA -> all file will be re andled -> load into browser)

10 - Componened -> 1 sec 
1000 - Componened -> 10 sec 


Vite: 
   
Multiple Cloths -> Componened
Create a Jacket -> gives only files those are needed  
Jacket's pokcet you want of different color -> only pocket file will change

10 - Componened 1 sec
1000 - Componened 1 sec 

ESM -> ECMAScript Module -> Import / Export

Building first Vite tool App for React 

syntax to create a vite app 
npm create vite@latest -> (replacement for npx create react app) 

npm create vite@latest -- --template react 

isEven -> number is even or not
SPA -> Single page application 
index.html -> root HTML file 
App.jsx -> root Componened
main.jsx -> Entry point: React start from here 


There can be many componands in the application -> each  componands return JSX 

1 -> Combination of HTML and JS 
2 -> class -> className 
3 -> Self closing tags are mandaotry <img src="link" > not allowed <img src="link" />
4 -> camelCase -> autofocus -> autoFocus 
5 -> all tags must return one parent element 
6 -> JavaScript go inside {} 

Props: 
    It stands for properties, we can pass props as an arguments to our Componened
    1 - Read Only 
    2 - We can Desctrture props 


State Lifting:
    when Multiple componands need to share or coordinate one piece of state 
    we lift the state up to their common parent. 


    counter app -> a componand to show the counter  -> Display
                   a componand to increase the counter value  -> Button
                   a parent componand that will hold both -> Display , Button
