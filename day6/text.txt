    CSS -> React
    Sorting
    Filtering
    Searching 
    useMemo -> introduce 

LOs for today
    useMemo
    useCallback 
    memo 
    Routing -> Main LO for today 


    whenever there is change is product array or in searchTerm or in OrderBy -> sorting and filtering should happen 
    solution: useMemo -> it a hook that takes a callback function and return computed value, there will be a dependency array
    until there is no change in dependency array it will not recompute same value 


    whenever there is no change in child component and don't want to rereder that component -> need to use React.memo 

    React.memo() -> compute the compount -> if there is any change in the props or state of child component then only it 
    will rerender 


    until function logic is not changing, we don't want to recreate the function 
    useCallback -> it will prevent recreateion of function
    
    useCallback(callback , [dependency array])

    useMemo -> avoid unwated function execution 
    React.memo -> memo -> avoid unwanted component rerender
    useCallback -> avoid recreation of function 

    VDOM -> it will check if there is any change in the state of the component, if yes
    it will compare with previous one and update the values -> component will rerender  

    useMemo -> it compute the value -> and takes a dependency array, if there is no change in dependency
             value will not be recomputed 



    React -> SPA -> it will not reload 

    there will be multiple pages, each page will have respective data 
    will be moving accorss the pages 

 <a href="/about" >


 we should be able to move accross the pages 
 -> Routing -> it will helps to move accross the pages 
 react-router-dom -> its a liberary -> to handle routing 

 we need to wrap our application in the 
 BrowserRouter 

 Routes -> we need to define all the pages as a route inside router
 Route -> single page address 
 Link -> path -> so that page don't get reload 


 product page -> contains multiple products 
 whenever click over a product -> product detail should come 

 usePrams -> extract the Routes parameter
