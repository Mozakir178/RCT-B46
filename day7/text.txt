useNavigate 

I don't have any option to navigate to Products page 

useNavigate
    it will provide us option to move to a specific route based on condition 


    path
    home
    about
    home
    Products
    product/1

    navigate(5) -> if possible it will move 5 step ahead if not, whatever is the last step possible 
    navigate(-5) -> if possible it will move 5 step back, if not, whatever was the first page 



useSearchParams:
    useSearchParam is a react hook 
    read the current query string (path= product?sort=asc) sort -> query string 
    update the query string in the URL programetically 


useLocation:
    similar to useSearchParams it will provide query string with this other details we will be able see
    path
    hash
    params
