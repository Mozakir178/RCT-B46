React -> Frontend 
Backend -> React is not responsible 
Backend Functionalit -> External resource 
Backend team -> they will be writing the backend code, you as a frontend developer, consuming those API

fakestoreapi -> we are getting all product details 

you don't have backend support -> either you don't know the backend or there is backend team 

service provider -> rent 

firebase -> CRUD operations 
        : Firebase is a Backend as a Service (BaaS)
        many backend functionality normally needed for any project 
        realtime database -> mongoDB -> NoSQL  -> Node -> database(MongoDB) -> Java (SQL -> MySQL Oracle Postgrase)
        API testing 
        Hosting 
        Authentication
        Storage
        Analytics 

Authentication: to varify? user 
    you will be taking data from the user (login form)
    you will be matching this data with users data present in the database 
    hashing the password -> 123456 encrypt 
    varifying these details 
    details are correct -> send them to dashboard else ask them to provide correct details 

    firebase -> everything related to backend -> if details provided by user are correct then firebase 
    will provide user credentials else error message (Promise)




firebase setup:
    go to firebase console (google account)
    add Project -> name -> some other details about project -> create project 
    test mode -> database not the foucus 

    go to console 
    get started with the firebase project
    give name and accept term and condtion and continue 
    disable google analytics and create project 
    click over web(</>) icon
    create app 
    it will give you basic setup 
    click over Authentication
    click get started button
    select email/password
    enable this 
    save 
    create firebase.js -> communicate with firebase 
    will need firebase library npm install firebase 
    api key -> our react app will communicate with firebase -> api key varification 



    // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    // TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
    // https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

    // Your web app's Firebase configuration
    const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyC36bpxcA6pinYLcxkuEETVBEorD0C3oQQ",
    authDomain: "fir-auth-99725.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "fir-auth-99725",

    appId: "1:784467985876:web:d0ae36d7184b867ee3c241"
    };

    // Initialize Firebase
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);


    // functions provided by firebase auth 
    1. createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth , email , password) -> to create a new user (singup)
    2. signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email,password) -> login/signup 
    3. signOut(auth) -> logout 
    4. onAuthStateChange(auth , callback) -> Similar to Mount-> whenever state is changing it will be notified by this function  


    Context API -> all the things will be keeping in auth 

    auth -> it is an object -> helping us to communicate with firebase and provide login logout and signi
